The "distro map" file, `_distro_map.yml`, is a required configuration component for a docs repo managed by AsciiBinder. This is the file that tells AsciiBinder everything it needs to know about:

* Every variation, or _distro_, of your documentation set, and
* All of the branches in your git repository and how they relate to each distro

Because we are talking about a git repo and because we will almost certainly have multiple branches in that repo, there is one thing that is very important to understand about the distro map file:

NOTE: AsciiBinder only reads `_distro_map.yml` once, from the working branch of your docs repo, and does not reread it while it is processing different git repo branches.

For this reason, it is good practice to ensure that the version of this document that resides in your repository's `master` branch is the canonical reference for the current state of all branches of your repo. When you start a publication build of your site(s), you will want to start it in the branch that is your canonical latest branch, which will be `master` for most people.

== Distro Map Example
Here is a very basic sample distro map. In this map, we have one distro called "AsciiBinder" with one version called "Latest":

----
---  <1>
ascii_binder: <2>
  name: AsciiBinder
  author: AsciiBinder Team <team@asciibinder.net>
  site: main
  site_name: Home
  site_url: https://asciibinder.net/
  branches: <3>
    master: <4>
      name: Latest
      dir: latest <5>

----
<1> Each distro configuration is preceeded by this three-hash (`---`) record delimiter.
<2> This "distro key" must be unique for each variation of your docs.
<3> Each distro will be associated with at least one git branch.
<4> Branch records are keyed to their actual git branch name
<5> In the generated HTML website, the branch will be published under this directory

When you create a new docs repo with `asciibinder create`, a similar map is created for you in `_distro_map.yml`.

== Distro Map Reference
Here is a complete listing of settings supported in the distro map file.

=== Distro Record Settings
Each distro record must contain all of the following settings:

`<distro_key>`::
  Each distro record is identified by a key that must be unique. This key must satisfy the formatting rules required for http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attribute-restrictions[attributes in AsciiDoc], because this key will be _used_ as an attribute in AsciiDoc. Any time you want to conditionalize your document in a way that is specific to this distro, you can use this key in conjunction with http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#ifdef-directive[AsciiDoc `ifdef::` directives] to accomplish that.

The rest of theses settings are sub-settings under each distro key:

`name`::
  This is the display name of the distro. In the AsciiDoc topic files, this value is available as `product-title`. In the HTML ERB templates, this is available as `<%= distro %>`.
`author`::
  This is the author name for the distro. In the AsciiDoc topic files, this value is exposed as `product-author`.
`site`::
  This is a unique key used to identify the website to which this distro will be published. When you run `asciibinder package` to produce publish-ready static HTML, every distro with the same `site` value will be assembeld to be published with the same website. Conversely, distros with different site keys will be packaged for distribution to separate sites.
`site_name`::
  This is the display name of the website where the distro will be published. This is available in the HTML ERB templates as `<%= site_name %>`.
`site_url`::
  This is the web address of the site where the distro will be published. This is available in the HTML ERB templates as `<%= site_url %>`.
`branches`::
  This key references a list of branch records. Each distro must contain at least one branch record in this list. Every branch associated with a distro represents a different _version_ of the distro. Branch record contents are described in Branch Record Settings.

=== Branch Record Settings
Each branch record must contain the settings listed as required, and may contain the optional settings as well.

`<git_branch_name>`::
  Each branch record is identified by an actual git branch name. As AsciiBinder runs, it will actually change between branches in your local git repo to produce different distro/branch combintations of your documentation set. The same branch can be associated with multiple distros; for instance, the `master` branch could be included for multiple distros as the "Latest" version of each distro.

The rest of theses settings are sub-settings under each git branch name:

`name` (required)::
  This is the display name of the branch (think "version name"). In the HTML ERB templates, this is available as `<%= version %>`.
`dir` (required)::
  This is the target directory for this distro/branch copy of the complete docs set. This should be expressed as a relative path from the root directory of your website, and should only include URI-legal characters.
`distro-overrides` (optional)::
  The `name` and `author` values of the distro record can be overridden on a branch-by-branch basis. As an example, this is useful for a situation where your distro changes names from one version to the next, and you want to preserve the old name for use with the older versions.

.Example usage of `distro-overrides`

Initially, the fine folks at "p9000.com" have a product called Product 9000, and they've released two versions:

----
---
product-9000:
  name: Product 9000
  author: Product 9000 Crew <crew@p9000.com>
  site: commercial
  site_name: Home
  site_url: https://docs.p9000.com/
  branches:
    version-1.0:
      name: v1.0
      dir: product-9000/1.0
    version-2.0:
      name: v2.0
      dir: product-9000/2.0
----

Now they are changing the product name for the next version, but are still planning to keep the docs for the previous versions around. Here is the recommended approach:

----
---
product-9000: <1>
  name: Product 9001 <2>
  author: Product 9001 Crew <crew@p9000.com> <2>
  site: commercial
  site_name: Home
  site_url: https://docs.p9000.com/
  branches:
    version-1.0:
      name: v1.0
      dir: product-9000/1.0
      distro-overrides: <3>
        name: Product 9000
        author: Product 9000 Crew <crew@p9000.com>
    version-2.0:
      name: v2.0
      dir: product-9000/2.0
      distro-overrides: <3>
        name: Product 9000
        author: Product 9000 Crew <crew@p9000.com>
    version-3.0:
      name: v3.0
      dir: product-9001/3.0
----
<1> The distro key does not _need_ to change. It is visible to contributors but is not visible in the finished product, and in large doc sets that change could be pretty painful.
<2> The overall distro record gets the _new_ product name and author.
<3> The branches of the _previous_ versions get the overrides. This way, when support for them is eventually dropped, what remains in the distro record is the "new normal".
